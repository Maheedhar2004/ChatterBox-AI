This project is a fully functional chatbot user interface designed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It focuses on integrating rich browser-based features like voice recognition, text-to-speech, and file upload — all in a sleek, responsive chat window. The design and functionality make it ideal for further integration with AI models or backend APIs.

🔥 Key Highlights
✅ Minimal frontend stack — runs entirely in the browser with no framework dependencies
🧠 Voice to Text — speaks your message using the browser's speech recognition
🗣️ Text to Speech — reads bot messages aloud in multiple languages
📁 File Upload — supports image file uploads (future-ready for OCR or AI analysis)
📦 Lightweight — no libraries or frameworks required; just open index.html to use.

NOTE:  You have to place your API-KEY(gemini,openai...) in script.js file.
